# imrabo AI SDK

Welcome to the imrabo AI SDK documentation (Python). This site documents the public API, design principles, provider adapter rules, and examples to help you implement and consume the SDK.

Use the **Getting Started** page to install and make your first call.

> The SDK is intentionally small and boring: two public functions — `generate` and `stream` — and a strict provider contract.
